# Web Crypto App

The project provides information about the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization at the moment.

## üî• Introduction

The project uses requests to the CoinGecko API (https://www.coingecko.com/). On the main page, there is first a section for the user to connect to their MetaMask wallet (The user needs to have the MetaMask extension installed in their browser) and see their ETH balance. Additionally, there are 10 cards presented with the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization at the moment. Each card is clickable and leads to a specific page of the respective cryptocurrency, which presents more data about it such as: highest and lowest price in the last 24 hours, chart with price variation (made with the Apex Charts library), and total market volume.
